tumblr-auth
===========

Easily create an oauth-authenticated tumblr client.

## Overview
This module makes it easy to complete the 3-legged oauth process from the command line. It walks you through getting your oauth token & secret, writes them to a config file for later use, and gives you an authenticated Tumblr client to use. It uses the excellent "tumblr_client" gem so please refer to its documentation for more on what you can do with it.

## Installation
Install the necessary gems:

	%> bundle install

Create the config file (using the sample):

	%> cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml

NOTE: Make sure your config file is writable by you (or your app) so that it can store the oauth token & secret for you. 

Go to http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps to get the consumer key & consumer secret for your app.

Plug these values into the config.yaml file

Finito.
	
## Usage
See "sample.rb" for a sample app.

	#require the module-file
	require './tumblr_auth.rb'

	#create a new client using the module's "get_authenticated_client" method
	client = TumblrAuth::get_authenticated_client

	#do something with it...
	puts client.info
